<!-- # Plan

- [x] Restructure the project into a much cleaner design  
- [ ] Remove OpenSSL/WolfSSL client, create a TLS client using curl-impersonate  
- [ ] Rework OpenSSL server, configure options to match Nginx identically  
- [ ] Focus on HTTP/1 or HTTP/2, make every option configurable via JSON  
- [ ] Redesign Layer 3 nodes with a different architecture  
- [x] Add support for WireGuard  
- [ ] Add support for Router  
- [ ] Implement more transports like HTTP/3 or a stream control node
